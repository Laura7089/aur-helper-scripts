# AUR Package Maintenance Scripts

A small collection of scripts that I use to maintain my AUR packages.
Requires [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

This repository is structured such that one adds directories to it containing `PKGBUILD`s/other package build files.
Once it's populated, see `just -l` for available scripts/tools.
